Vine robots are inflatable soft robots that can robustly interact with dynamic environments. They can make contact with the environment at no risk (unlike rigid robots), which makes them great for planning and design optimization tasks.

Previous work has focused on planning under contact for passively deforming vines, but here we investigate *active* steering, which is needed for more complex environments. We develop a unified modeling framework that integrates many physical parameters: growth, bending, actuation, and obstacle contact. 

We apply our model in a design optimization task to synthesize vine robots that can navigate through cluttered environments, identifying designs that minimize the number of required actuators by exploiting environmental contacts. Finally, we fabricate the best vine in real life and successfully deploy it in a obstacle course.

# Install

```bash
# If you don't have CUDA capability then remove the jaxlib=*=*cuda*
conda create -n vine jax 'numpy<2' scipy numba matplotlib pandas flax line_profiler "jaxlib=*=*cuda*" jaxopt scikit-learn
conda activate vine

pip install pygame ompl
```

# Run

This repo is divied into multiple parts

- `geometric` The geometric motion planner that finds approximate but dense solutions for the design in order to guide the kinodynamic planner. 
- `kinodynamic` The physically accurate (but slower) planner that uses the vine simulator to explore feasible trajectories.  
- `pbd_vine.py` A JAX vine simulator that finds the forward time evolution of vine states, using Position Based Dynamics to find stable solutions for soft bodies.
- `sPAM` The (inverse) sPAM model, which finds the design parameters to produce a vine that curves at a given angle. Contains a numerical solver and neural surrogate.
- `experiments` Code for experiments; robustness tests, planner comparisons, and plots.  
- `envs` All environment files.

For planning

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)
python kinodynamic/sst.py --env envs/divider.txt
```

Runs the geometric planner followed by the kinodynamic planner which jointly find vine designs to solve the given env file.  It runs indefinitely in its search for better solutions. Hit ctrl + c to stop it. You can check stats like the minimum solution cost on the top right.

The solutions are saved to `cache/`. View them using

```bash
python kinodynamic/view_solutions.py
```

# Troubleshooting
If you are getting angry yellow warnings about "invalid start state" from rrt, despite the start state being prefectly collision free -- this is not a logic error nor OMPL issue. It's something to do with Numba cache. Go to `_isStateValid` in `kinodynamic/fast_geo/biarc_rrtstar.py`, add some random `print()`, run the code once so Numba recompiles it, then remove the `print()` and it should be good. 

# Common Install Issues
`RuntimeWarning: Your system is avx2 capable but pygame was not built with support for it. The performance of some of your blits could be adversely affected. Consider enabling compile time detection with environment variables like PYGAME_DETECT_AVX2=1 if you are compiling without cross compilation.`
Remove pygame from conda and install via pip instead
